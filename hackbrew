Yes.

I modified the install script to not use sudo and to use a directory of your choice. https://gist.github.com/skyl/36563a5be809e54dc139

Download that, set YOUR_HOME in the script to the absolute path. chmod +x the script. Create the YOUR_HOME/usr/local directory. Then, execute the script.

./install.rb
In .bash_profile, I set (I'm not positive this is important, pretty sure):

export HOMEBREW_PREFIX=/The/path/to/YOUR_HOME/usr/local
Now, I can:

brew install wget
Make sure the bin directory, YOUR_HOME + /usr/local/bin is on your $PATH.

which wget
